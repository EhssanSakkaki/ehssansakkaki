<p>For this project, I created an interactive story using images generated with Nano Banana through my paid Adobe Firefly account.
  My main goal was to tell a short narrative story where the user is not just watching, but actively making choices.
  I wanted the player to feel involved and curious about what would happen next.<br>

Instead of using only text, I focused on using images to drive the story forward.
Each image represents a moment or a location in the story, and the choices allow the player to move through different parts of the narrative.
Even though some paths lead to dead ends, they are still part of the experience and help guide the player back to the main story.<br>

The assignment itself was not very difficult, but it required a lot of planning.
I had to think carefully about how the story would flow, how many choices to give, and how each choice would connect to the next scene.
Planning the structure ahead of time helped me avoid confusion later and made the experience smoother for the player.<br>

I also spent time adjusting the design of the website to make the visuals stand out more.
I changed colors, hover effects, and layout so the interface would feel more immersive and match the futuristic theme of the story.
Overall, this project helped me understand how storytelling, visual design, and user interaction work together to create a more engaging experience.<br>
