<p>I found an image of President Trump on the Wikipedia Commons, then find the higher quality on the New York Times. I composited it by using masks over the toilet image I created by Firefly AI. Then I imported several images and put them in different places. I used Blending modes like Multiply for the graffities. I painted shadows using brush and used adjustment layers to color-correct the pieces of images.
  <br>I tried to highlight the political ideas, and labels that are often associated with the MAGA movement and the U.S. President. By placing these elements in a messy and unpleasant setting, I wanted to show how the presidency is surrounded by controversy and disorder, and how the President struggles to deal with it. </p><hr>

<p>I used a few images, found on Wikipedia Commons, including the White House, a photo of the border wall, and a flagpole, to create this image. I also used President Trump's hair instead of the meadow and grass at the bottom of the image. I used hard light blending mode on the text, and a brush to make it imperfect. I used Hue/Saturation to create a sepia-looking image.
  <br>I wanted to ask if the idea of putting America first is really working. The border wall was built to protect Americans, but people still climb over it and get past it. This makes the policy seem ineffective. Instead of solving problems, it has mostly spread hate toward immigrants. </p><hr>
