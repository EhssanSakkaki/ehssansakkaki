<h1>Artist Statement</h1>

<p>My name is Ehssan Sakkaki. I'm a film and video editor, motion graphic designer, and filmmaker who uses storytelling to challenge ideas and spark curiosity. I grew up in Iran, where censorship and brainwashing were part of everyday life.  I know very well how much control can shape what we see and believe. I see filmmaking to question authority and explore freedom.  In my work, I combine technical skill with creative exploration, mixing 2D and 3D animation, motion graphics, and AI to tell stories in new ways. I'm always learning and experimenting because I believe technology opens fresh possibilities for expression. Whether I'm editing a film or designing visuals, I aim to create work that's honest, thought-provoking, and uncensored.</p>
