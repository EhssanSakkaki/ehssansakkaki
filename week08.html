<h1>Week 8</h1>

<h3>Part One, The Hopefulness</h3>
<img src="week08/week08_eye01.gif" width="40%"><br>
<p>By animating the eye blinking, I aimed to bring it to life.
  The light sweeping over the eye enhances the positive feeling it conveys.
  Using different layers in Photoshop and 21 frames, I tried to give this artwork an original look that evokes purpose and hope.

  <h3>Part Two, Lost in Space</h3>
<img src="week08/week08_spaceman_v2.gif" width="40%"><br>
<p>By using the puppet tool and 27 layers in photoshop, I created this gif to shows this cute spaceman pulling around in the space.
  Previously I worked with the puppet tool in After Effect many times,
  Although it was a bit challenging especially that there is no keyframes and inbetweens in photoshop. Ultimately it was a fun assignment.
