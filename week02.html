<h1>Ehssan Sakkaki</h1>
<h2>Week Two</h2>

<p>Reflection: I’m a motion graphic designer, video editor, animator, and aspiring filmmaker. I was born in Iran, where I worked on many feature films, TV shows, and short films before moving to the U.S. For me, storytelling has always been more than just entertainment, it’s a way to challenge ideas and make people think. Growing up under a theocratic regime, I saw how media could be used to control people’s beliefs. My mother once told me, “Choose your beliefs based on your own reasoning.” That advice changed my life. Today, I am interested in using visual art to question harmful ideologies, fight censorship, and promote freedom of thought.
  Reading Susan Sontag’s In Plato’s Cave made me think more deeply about photography. Her idea that photography is never neutral really hit me with the truth. I’ve always enjoyed artistic photography, especially nude, abstract, and figurative styles, but I now realize that even my personal taste reflects my own biases. Sontag’s point that photography is a form of appropriation made me reflect on how I view and create images. Whether I’m editing someone else’s footage or thinking about my own projects, I’m not just showing reality, I’m shaping it.
  Most of my work has been in post-production, helping bring other people’s ideas to life. But I’ve always had my own thoughts, especially about politics, religion, and taboo topics. Sontag’s view of the camera as a tool of power and control makes sense to me, especially because I’ve lived in a system that uses media to spread propaganda. I always see photography and any other visual arts not just as a way to capture beauty, but as a way to challenge meaning. In today’s world, where people mostly consume media that matches their own beliefs, I want to use visual art to criticize their beliefs even if they see it as offensive or even if it doesn’t break through those bubbles.
  This semester, I want to try and treat each of the projects as part of a bigger picture. I’ll explore themes like fragmentation and propaganda. I’m drawn to simple, direct, and natural photography, but I’ll also try adding graphics or text to express my ideas more clearly. By manipulating photography or adding graphics and words can help me question dominant narratives and invite viewers to think more critically.
  To represent today’s world visually, I’d focus on political division, especially the extremes on both the left and right, and the harmful ideas spread by religious, ideologies and political systems. I imagine using raw, documentary-style photos combined with surreal or manipulated elements. These images would reflect the confusion and distortion we see in society today.
  In the end, image-making is how I engage with the world, not passively, but with purpose. As Sontag says, photography isn’t just about seeing but it’s about choosing what to see and why. Through my work, I hope to challenge people, spark conversations, and encourage others to look deeper into the systems that shape our lives.</p>
